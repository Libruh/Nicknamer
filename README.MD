# Nicknamer

## Invite Link
Add the bot to your server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=974129951907397642&permissions=75776&scope=bot)!

## What is this?
Nicknamer is a small project I began to practice AI response generation.

## What's the goal?
The end goal is to produce a nickname for a Discord user based on the introduction they post when joining a server

## What does it do now?
When an introduction is sent to a server's introduction channel, it will spit out a nickname into the general channel. For this bot to work, you must have two text channels. One called "#general" and one called "#introductions" respectively. 

## Who's idea was this?
It was my friend Sierra's! She originally suggested this idea on the Good Kid Street Team Discord server.
