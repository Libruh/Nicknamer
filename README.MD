# Nicknamer
## What is this?
Nicknamer is a small project I began to practice AI response generation.

## What's the goal?
The end goal is to produce a nickname for a Discord user based on the introduction they post when joining a server

## What does it do now?
When an introduction is sent to a server's introduction channel, it will spit out a nickname into another specified channel. This is still a WIP, so nicknames should only be displayed where others cannot see them until properly adjusted.

## Who's Idea was this?
It was my friend Sierra's! She originally suggested this idea on the Good Kid Street Team Discord server.
