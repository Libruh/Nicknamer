# Nicknamer
## What is this?
Nicknamer is a small project I began to practice AI response generation.

## What's the goal?
The end goal is to produce a nickname for a Discord user based on the introduction they post when joining a server

## What does it do now?
Currently, the project generates a random user based on a list of fictional people in `users.txt`, then, when connected to a discord server, collects nickname ideas for training purposes from users in the form of a game.

## What's the hold up?
Upon completeing debugging, I reached the usage limit for a free account on the AI provider. I am currently awaiting an extension.

## Who's Idea was this?
It was my friend Sierra's! She originally suggested this idea on the Good Kid Street Team Discord server.
